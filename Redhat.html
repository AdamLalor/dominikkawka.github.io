<h1> Week 1 </h1>

<p>How to use a mac book
Learned how to use the commands pwd + ls + cd + mkdir
How to commit stuff to github
Git add README > git commit -m "first commit" > git push
Windows isn't good for coding/programming 
Linux and mac is the way to go </p>
<h1> Week 2 </h1>

<p>We learned more basic things with coding, such as making tables, bold , strikethrough and underline </p>

<h3>Spaghetti and marshmellow challenge</h3>

<p>Our tower fell, but It thought us to learn by trail and error, and not to try to make one big plan and fail<p>

<h3>UI and UX</h3>

<p>User interface >> Displaying the information needed and is easy to read eg Minecraft with the hotbar,health,hunger,exp and armour </p>

<p>User eXperience >> Does the website have a meaning, a dedicated audience</p>

<h2> Week 3 </h2>

</h3>We started to learn JavaScript </h3>

<p>var Age = "15"; </p>
<p>console.log("I am " + age) - I am 15 </p>
<p>console.log(true);</p>
<p>console.log(false);</p>
<p>console.log(null);</p>
<p>console.log(33);</p>
<p>console.log("woo");</p>
    
<p>You can also do console.log(3 + 4). Subtract(-) Multiply(Asterik) and Divide (/) </p>

<p>console.log("gdhasuidbasuio".length) Shows how many characters the thing in the quotes has (It has 14)</p>

<p>console.log("ndsiao".toUpperCase()); Makes "ndsiao" all uppercase</p>

<h3> Codeacademy </h3>
      
<p>Math.random() generates a number between 1 and 0</p>
<p>Math.floor() rounds up or down a number</p>
<p>Math.floor(Math.random() * 50); Multiplies the number by 50</p>
<p>console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100))</p>

<p><b>I personally feel that with Code academy is a bad way to learn, after half an hour I already can't remember most of the things that I've done.</b><p>

<h3>Breakout</h3>

<p>The breakout game is doing well so far, I understand most of the codes meaning
I couldn't get the collision to work so I had to look up a solution.
Another problem - Whenever I would make the table for the ping pong, all the props would disappear; Fixed > Moved some of the coding and it worked
I refuse to make mouse controls for a game like this. </p>

<h1> Week 4 </h1>
<p> I learned how to do everything above <b> AND </b> I learned about the existence of twined </p> </p>

<h1> Week 5 </h1>
<p> We started to work on this website, I made the navigation tools and added some content to the website, it looks like we did nothing at all this week but it's the opposite. Div id and Div class was also introduced, but I don't understand most of it.Position: absolute; left:50px = 50px to the right. top:50px = 50 px to the bottom.</p>
<p> Position:fixed = I don't understand</p>
<p>position:relative = realitve to itself, forgets about the browser</p>
