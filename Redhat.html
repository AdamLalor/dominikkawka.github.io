            On my first week at redhat I learned how to use a mac book
 Learned how to use the commands pwd + ls + cd + mkdir
 How to commit stuff to github
 Git add README > git commit -m "msg" > git push
 Windows isn't good for coding/programming 
 Linux and mac is the way to go</div>

 <h3>Spaghetti and marshmellow challenge</h3>

 <p>Our tower fell, but It thought us to learn by trail and error, and not to try to make one big plan and fail<p>

 <h3>UI and UX</h3>

 <p>User interface >> Displaying the information needed and is easy to read eg Minecraft with the hotbar,health,hunger,exp and armour </p>

 <p>User eXperience >> Does the website have a meaning, a dedicated audience</p>

        </h4>

      <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body"><h1> Week 3 </h1>

     </h3>We started to learn JavaScript </h3>

     <p>var Age = "15"; </p>
     <p>console.log(true);</p>
     <p>console.log(false);</p>
     <p>console.log(null);</p>
     <p>console.log(33);</p>
     <p>console.log("woo");</p>
    
     <p>You can also do console.log(3 + 4). Subtract(-) Multiply(Asterik) and Divide (/) </p>

     <p>console.log("gdhasuidbasuio".length) Shows how many characters the thing in the quotes has (It has 14)</p>

     <p>console.log("ndsiao".toUpperCase()); Makes "ndsiao" all uppercase</p>

     <h3> Codeacademy </h3>
      
     <p>Math.random() generates a number between 1 and 0</p>
     <p>Math.floor() rounds up or down a number</p>
     <p>Math.floor(Math.random() * 50); Multiplies the number by 50</p>
     <p>console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100))</p>

     <p><b>I personally feel that with Code academy is a bad way to learn, after half an hour I already can't remember most of the things that I've done.</b></p>

     <h3>Breakout</h3>

     <p>The breakout game is doing well so far, I understand most of the codes meaning
     I couldn't get the collision to work so I had to look up a solution.
     Another problem - Whenever I would make the table for the ping pong, all the props would disappear; Fixed > Moved some of the coding and it worked
     I refuse to make mouse controls for a game like this. </p></div>

         We started to make the foundations of this very website, We also cleaned up our github.Our website can also host multiple pages.I learned about the existence of twined, oh and we made a boat out of some cups, string,duct tape and straws</div>

           <p>We started to work on this website, I made the navigation tools and added some content to the website,The navigation bar seemed impossible but thanks to google I was able to make one that would function correctly it looks like we did nothing at all this week but it's the opposite. Div id and Div class was also introduced, but I don't understand most of it.Position: absolute; left:50px = 50px to the right. top:50px = 50 px to the bottom.</p>

           position:fixed = I don't understand

          position:relative = realitve to itself, forgets about the browser</div>

            <p> I organised the the layout of the Redhat diary tab on my website, It was a massive pain since one of the tabs was being special, but after some trial and error I was able to find the mistakes and fixed this.Then I started to work on my CV and it was easy since I had the correct code now</p> </div>
