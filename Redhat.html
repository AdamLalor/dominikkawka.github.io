 <h3>Spaghetti and marshmellow challenge</h3>

 <p>Our tower fell, but It thought us to learn by trail and error, and not to try to make one big plan and fail<p>

 <h3>UI and UX</h3>

 <p>User interface >> Displaying the information needed and is easy to read eg Minecraft with the hotbar,health,hunger,exp and armour </p>

 <p>User eXperience >> Does the website have a meaning, a dedicated audience</p>

     </h3>We started to learn JavaScript </h3>
     <ul class="list">
     <li class="list">var Age = "15";</li>
     <li class="list">console.log(true);</li>
     <li class="list">console.log(false);</li>
     <li class="list">console.log(null);</li>
     <li class="list">console.log(33);</li>
     <li class="list">console.log("woo");</li>
     </ul>
     <p>You can also do console.log(3 + 4). Subtract(-) Multiply(Asterik) and Divide (/) </p>

     <p>console.log("gdhasuidbasuio".length) Shows how many characters the thing in the quotes has (It has 14)</p>

     <p>console.log("ndsiao".toUpperCase()); Makes "ndsiao" all uppercase</p>

     <h3> Codeacademy </h3>
      
     <p>Math.random() generates a number between 1 and 0</p>
     <p>Math.floor() rounds up or down a number</p>
     <p>Math.floor(Math.random() * 50); Multiplies the number by 50</p>
     <p>console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100))</p>

     <p><b>I personally feel that with Code academy is a bad way to learn, after half an hour I already can't remember most of the things that I've done.</b></p>

     <h3>Breakout</h3>

     <p>The breakout game went well, I was able to get most of the things working and I knew what most of the code meant</p>
     <p>I couldn't get the collision to work so I had to look up a solution. </p>
     <p>Another problem - Whenever I would make the table for the ping pong, all the props would disappear; Fixed > Moved some of the coding and it worked</p>
     <p>I refuse to make mouse controls for a game like this. Instead I made the paddle move with the left and right arrow keys</p></div>

           <p>We started to work on this website, I made the navigation tools and added some content to the website,The navigation bar seemed impossible but thanks to google I was able to make one that would function correctly it looks like we did nothing at all this week but it's the opposite.</p>

            <p>After that we have started to fix our website, I had a lot to do and I only have finished two tabs,which is this tab and the CV</p>
