## **Week 2** 

**Spaghetti and marshmellow challenge**

Our tower fell, but It thought us to learn by trail and error, and not to try to make one big plan and fail

*UI and UX*

User interface >> Displaying the information needed and is easy to read eg Minecraft with the hotbar,health,hunger,exp and armour 

User eXperience >> Does the website have a meaning, a dedicated audience

## **Week 3 **

We started to learn JavaScript

var Age = "15";
console.log("I am " + age) - I am 15

===

console.log(true);

console.log(false);

console.log(null);

console.log(33);

console.log("woo");

===

You can also do console.log(3 + 4). Subtract(-) Multiply(Asterik) and Divide (/)

===

console.log("gdhasuidbasuio".length) Shows how many characters the thing in the quotes has (It has 14)

console.log("ndsiao".toUpperCase()); Makes this all uppercase

===

**Remove Whitespace - I can't do it :(( **

===

Math.random() generates a number between 1 and 0

Math.floor() rounds up or down a number

Math.floor(Math.random() * 50); Multiplies the number by 50 

I had trouble with this. but the correct code is below vvv
===

console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100))

===

I personally feel that with Code academy is a bad way to learn, after half an hour I already can't remember most of the things that I've done.

Ping pong game
===

The ping pong game is doing well so far, I understand most of the codes meaning

I couldn't get the collision to work so I had to look up a solution.

Another problem - Whenever I would make the table for the ping pong, all the props would disappear; Fixed > Moved some of the coding and it worked

I refuse to make mouse controls for a game like this.
